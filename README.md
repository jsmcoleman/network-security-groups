<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create Resource Group and virtual Machines
- Observe ICMP Traffic
- Observe SSH Traffic
- Observe DHCP Traffic
- Observe DNS Traffic
- Observe RDP Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

I created a resource group and two virtual machines. One on windows 10 and the other on Linux (ubuntu). I connected to windows 10 with the public IP address and Ubuntu with the private IP address.

After connecting to the Windows 10 virtual machine I installed Wireshark. Within wireshark I tested the ICMP traffic and observed. On the Windows 10 virtal machine I attempted to ping the private IP address of the Ubuntu virtual machine. Then, I opened Powershell and attempted to ping a public website. Lastly, I initiated a perpetual ping from my windows 10 virtual machine to my Ubuntu Virtual machine.
